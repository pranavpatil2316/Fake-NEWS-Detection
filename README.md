# 📰 Fake News Detection

This project is a machine learning model to detect fake news articles using Python. It uses two datasets: `true.csv` (real news) and `fake.csv` (fake news).

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of two files:
- `true.csv`: Real news articles
- `fake.csv`: Fake news articles

Make sure these files are in the same directory as the notebook/script.

## 🧠 Model

The model is built using:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression (or any other ML model you used)

## 📊 Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
- nltk / re (for text cleaning)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
